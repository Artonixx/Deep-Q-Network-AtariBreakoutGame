# Deep-Q-Network-AtariBreakoutGame
Playing Atari Breakout Game with Reinforcement Learning ( Deep Q Learning )






# Overview 

This project follows the description of the [Deep Q Learning algorithm](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf) described in this paper.

# Installation Dependencies:

* Python 3.x
* Numpy
* OpenCV-Python
* PyGame
* PyTorch

# How To Run

* `git clone https://github.com/SnnGnc/Deep-Q-Network-AtariBreakoutGame.git`
* `cd brekout`
* To train the game;
* `python dqn.py train`,
* To test the pre-trained version,
* `python dqn.py test`

# What is Deep Q Learning and How does is work ?

I highly recommend to read this [Demystifying Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://ai.intel.com/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/) who are curious about reinforcement learning.
